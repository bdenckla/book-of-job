Reviewing all the WLC bracket-c notes ...

I find that the first one actually with any relevant BHQ change is
jb22:12	רֹ֖אשׁ (has טרחא in WLC)
It is now definitely a דחי in BHQ.
It is ambiguous in 1997 BHS because of the conventions regarding mark
placment under ר.
It looks more like a דחי in 1984 BHS than in 1997 BHS.
My guess is that the WLC editors read it as a דחי
in whatever version of BHS they were looking at,
but felt that טרחא was a better transcription of μL,
and hence coded it as טרחא with a bracket-c note.
So, the BHQ change (to unambiguous דחי) disagrees with WLC.
So, the change in BHQ isn't really a change at all,
if we take BHS to have what I think the WLC editors thought BHS
had, namely, a דחי.
