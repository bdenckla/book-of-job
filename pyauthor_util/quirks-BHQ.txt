# Below "All good" means:
#    As expected, BHL main (both ketiv and qere, if relevant) matches ML above.
#    As expected, BHLA has no entry for this.
#    As expected, UXLC matches ML above.
#    As expected, MAM matches MA above.

# 1:21 יָצָ֜תִי MA MY | יצתי ML(ket) | יָצָ֜אתִי ML(qere) (differ-orth)
# All good.
# We might call this a "trivial qere" in ML that MA & MY found so trivial as to not merit a qere.
# Surprisingly, not noted in Da-at Miqra.

# 2:7 ְעַ֥ד MA MY | עד Mket | וְעַד Mqere
# I am not sure what BHQ is getting at here. Is BHQ just trying to explicitly say that MA & MY agree with ML?

# Come on, the letter in question (the last) has a רפה and even has a little serif that might make it ד.
# BHL main ends in ד, and BHLA has no entry for this.

# 6:21 לֹ֑א MA MY (T) | לא ML(ket) | ל֑וֹ ML(qere) (err-lex)
# All good.
# We might call this a "trivial qere" in ML that MA & MY found so trivial as to not merit a qere.
# Note that it is only trivial in that it makes no phonetic difference; it seems like it would make a pretty big semantic difference.

# BHL main has a simple word here, which is expected if we think ML has that, i.e. if we think ML is as above.
# BHLA has no entry for this, which is expected if we think a simple word is either the consensus, or there is no consensus on this issue.
# UXLC has a compound word here, disagreeing with ML above but agreeing with MAM regarding the contents of μL.
# MAM matches MY above, i.e. has a simple word here, and MAM notes that it is explicitly going against MA here.
# BHQ claims that ML has a simple word, not a compound word, but MAM says the opposite.
# Da-at Miqra says both MA and ML have a simple word here.

# 26:3 וְ֝תוּשִׁיָּ֗ה ML (differ-orth) | וְ֝תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה MA MY(qere)
