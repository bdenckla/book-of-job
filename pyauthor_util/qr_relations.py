"""Author-curated relations between quirkrec records.

A *relation* ties together the quirkrec records that together constitute
**one** divergence between μL and the consensus reading. It is the principled
signal — distinct from "same verse" — that lets a consumer know that N records
must be synthesized *jointly* rather than independently.

The seed (and currently only) kind is ``"move"``: an accent that μL writes on
one word is, in the consensus reading, relocated to a different word in the
same verse. Accent count is conserved (1 → 1); only the host word changes.
That conservation is the defining signature of a move.

Direction convention for kind ``"move"``:

* ``"from"`` = the **μL host** — the record whose word carries the accent in
  μL (on its ``qr-lc-proposed`` side) but loses it in the consensus.
* ``"to"``   = the **consensus host** — the record whose word gains the accent
  in the consensus (on its ``qr-consensus`` side).

So a move reads: "the consensus moves the *accent* **from** *from-word*
**to** *to-word*." Seed case (22:21): the אתנח μL writes on עמו is, in the
consensus, relocated to ושלם.

Records are named by their ``short_id`` (``CCVV[-WORDID]``); see
``pyauthor_util/short_id_etc.py``. ``QR_RELATIONS`` below is the single source
of truth: ``add_qr_rel_edges`` derives the two mirror-image, per-record
``qr-rel`` edges from each authored relation, so the mirrors can never desync.

``kind`` is kept as a field for extensibility (future split / merge / swap),
but only ``"move"`` is implemented today. Do **not** confuse a relation with:

* ``pgroup`` (a presentation group; orthogonal to "one divergence"),
* ``qr-cv`` (merely "same verse"; over-merges independent same-verse quirks),
* ``qr-auto-diff``'s intra-word "move" verb (a per-record, *within-one-word*
  diff; a relation here is *inter-word, across records*).
