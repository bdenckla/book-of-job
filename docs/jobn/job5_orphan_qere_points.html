<h1>Orphan pointing: manuscript precedent</h1>
<p>In Job 38:12, the Jerusalem Crown edition puts a פתח on no letter. The פתח floats before the ש of
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">שחר</span>. Although this is not the way μA or μL presents this
כתיב/קרי, there is manuscript precedent for such a floating presentation. This page presents some
examples of that precedent.</p>
<h2>2 Kings 4:7</h2>
<p>In 2 Kings 4:7 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?2Kings4:7">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/BD-2Kings.html#c4v7">M</a>), there is a קרי of
<bdi lang="hbo">וּבָנַ֔יִךְ</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב of <bdi lang="hbo">בניכי</bdi>.</p>
<p>This is hard to show in the “pointed כתיב” style of קרי/כתיב presentation favored by the
manuscripts. In such a style, the three diagonal קובוץ dots must float before the ב. The dots are
“orphans”: they belong to no letter of the כתיב word. The first image below is from μA; the second
is from μL. The קובוץ dots are faint in μL, almost invisible. (They are under the ת of the previous
word.)</p>

<h2>Lamentations 4:16</h2>
<p>In Lamentations 4:16 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Lamentations4:16">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/E3-Lamentations.html#c4v16">M</a>), there is a קרי
of <bdi lang="hbo">וּזְקֵנִ֖ים</bdi> corresponding to a כתיב of <bdi lang="hbo">זקנים</bdi>.</p>
<p>As in 2 Kings 4:7, the קובוץ dots must float before the first letter of the word, which in this
case is ז. Here is the way this word looks in Sassoon 1053:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="img/Sassoon-1053-Lamentations-c4v16.png" class="maxwidth50pc">

<h2>2 Samuel 18:20</h2>
<p>2 Samuel 18:20 (<a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?2Samuel18:20">U</a>,
<a href="https://bdenckla.github.io/MAM-with-doc/BB-2Samuel.html#c18v20">M</a>) is a קרי ולא כתיב:
the word <bdi lang="hbo">כֵּ֥ן</bdi> is read but not written.</p>
<p>So there are no letters <span class="unpointed-tanakh">כן</span> in the body text on which to put
the קרי pointing. This represents a more extreme case of orphan קרי points than the previous two
examples, since there is no word to which the orphan points can “snuggle up” to. In other words, the
vowel and accent marks of the קרי word, כן, float in the space between the surrounding כתיב words.
Or rather, the marks would float in that space if enough space had been left for them. As it is,
they somewhat awkwardly and confusingly reside beneath the ל.</p>
