<h1>BHQ Job: Not quite modern</h1>
<p>Like many students of the Hebrew Bible, I started out in the cult of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. I thought <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> was <b>the</b>
definitive edition of the Hebrew Bible. Unlike many students of the Hebrew Bible, I eventually
soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, and began to look for better editions. Such is the
power of the cult that the first alternative I looked into was <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>
(Biblia Hebraica Quinta). I was only bold enough to look outside of the cult of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, not outside of the cult of <abbr class="small-caps">DBG</abbr>
(Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft).</p>
<p>I found <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> disappointing, for my purposes. First of all,
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> is not only incomplete but also will not be complete for many
years. More importantly, <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, though it improves upon
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> in many ways, is still not quite <b>modern</b>. What I mean by
“not quite modern” is that it fails to incorporate the work of other editions. These other editions
include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> (Dotan, 2001)</li>
<li>דעת מקרא (Breuer et al., 1970&thinsp;–&thinsp;2003)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the first volume of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Megilloth) came out late enough
(2004) to incorporate Dotan’s work in <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr>. The חמש מגילות volume of
דעת מקרא came long before, in 1990.</p>
<p>Since I have said that I found <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> disappointing, for my
purposes, I should state what my purposes are. My purposes are narrowly focused on the Masoretic
text. I am not concerned with the many parts of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> that deal with
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sources in languages other than Hebrew</li>
<li>non-Masoretic (e.g. unpointed) Hebrew sources</li>
<li>Masorah magna and parva</li>
<li>the meaning of the text</li>
</ul>
<p>For all I know, these parts of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are of the highest quality,
and improve greatly on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. But these parts are not my concern.</p>
<p>This document discusses the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> edition of the Book of Job,
focusing on its treatment of certain textual variants. Right now it consists merely of this
