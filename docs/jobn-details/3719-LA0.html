<p>The distinction between the מרכא accent, the געיה mark, and the טרחא accent is a vexing problem.
Perhaps in some manuscripts, the angle of these marks can help make this distinction, but μL is not
such a manuscript. We can, as usual, lean on consensus for help, although consensus based on
manuscript evidence is hard to determine in these cases due to this same problem of
angle-reliability mentioned above. Notably, I suspect that μA is more reliable than μL in this
regard, but I am not sure. So, in these cases, in determining consensus, we may have to rely more
than usual on the evidence of printed editions. We may also have to rely more than usual on context
like the grammar of cantillation, to determine which of these marks is most likely in a given
situation. Aside: the מקף is very faint. — <a href="https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Job37:19">U</a> —
