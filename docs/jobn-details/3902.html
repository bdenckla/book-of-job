<p>The mark in question is very heavy, having a stroke width more typical of a letter-stroke than of
a niqqud-stroke. Its clarity suggests it is part of the re-inking. Indeed perhaps it is only part of
the re-inking, i.e. perhaps it reflects no mark (or only a much smaller mark) in the original. The
mark in question may be two marks, a רביע (expected) overlaid with a גרש (unexpected). Or, it may be
only a single mark whose lower end is, for some reason, a blob.</p>
<p><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> silently supplies the רביע that is the consensus expectation.
It may be interesting to note that <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> had the רביע on ד. Like all
changes in <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, this change had to be discovered, since changes from
1997 <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> to <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are undocumented. It
is a painful “exercise left to the reader” to discover such changes. The lack of documentation is a
<abbr class="small-caps">DBG</abbr> tradition carried over from <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>,
which lacks documentation for both its 1977 to 1984 changes and its 1984 to 1997 changes.</p>
