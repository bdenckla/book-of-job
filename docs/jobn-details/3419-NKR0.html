<p>The possible דגש is faint. The adjacent דגש (on כ) and other nearby marks are quite clear,
casting suspicion on the legitimacy of this דגש.</p>
<p><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> has no דגש here. I happen to think that this is the best
transcription of μL here, but I don’t know whether <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> arrived at
this transcription on purpose or by accident. Did the editors of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>
consider, but ultimately decide against, the faint possible דגש? Or did they simply ignore μL
entirely, supplying the consensus pointing, which has no דגש?</p>
<p>Since <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> does not note any uncertainty in its transcription
here, it is hard to distinguish whether <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> has ignored the mark in
question on purpose or by accident.</p>
<p>More broadly, <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job never notes any uncertainty in its
transcription of μL. This may mislead many readers. Despite the fact that high-resolution, color
images of μL are now widely available, many readers will not engage with those images enough to
understand how often there is great uncertainty in transcribing μL. And, even if the reader
understands that such uncertainty exists in general, <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> should, in
my opinion, indicate to the reader the specific cases where its transcription is particularly
uncertain.</p>
