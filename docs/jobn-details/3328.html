<p>Note that above we only show (and are only concerned with) the קרי form.</p>
<p>In μA, the letters are so faint as to be almost illegible, but as is often the case in μA, the
pointing is quite clear, perhaps because it was done in an ink that aged better. Fortunately it is
the pointing, not the letters, that are at issue here, and in any case, the pointing allows us to
“back-decipher” the letters and see that the רביע dot in question is indeed present on top of the
(faint) ת.</p>
<p>In all three manuscripts, an orphan חולם dot appears between the ת and the
<span class="romanized">yod</span> of the כתיב letters. It belongs, conceptually, to the
<span class="romanized">vav</span> of the קרי.</p>
<p>In μY, another dot appears above the <span class="romanized">yod</span>, very large compared to
the other dots, and oval rather than round. I am not sure how to interpret it.</p>
