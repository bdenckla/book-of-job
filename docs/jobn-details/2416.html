<p>I have shown the consensus with רפה to make my point clearer, but a consensus edition would not
typically show it. (It would, as usual, merely imply it rather than show it.)</p>
<p>In contrast, I show the רפה on the proposed reading, because I feel it should be shown in any
edition that, like <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, has דגש. This רפה is important, to highlight
the weirdness of the situation. In other words, by showing the רפה on the proposed reading, I am
sort of charitably transcribing <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>.</p>
<p>A דגש on a letter with רפה doesn’t make sense. The dot in question is suspiciously larger than
nearby ones, and looks different from them in other ways. See
<a href="../jobn-details/1905.html">19:5</a>.</p>
<p><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> notes this possibility, whereas this is not noted in the
other editions under consideration. It could be the editors of those other editions did not catch
this, or it could be that they caught it but considered it to be too slight a possibility to note
it.</p>
