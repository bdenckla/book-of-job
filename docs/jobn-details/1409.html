<p>The possible דגש looks slightly different than the four nearby dots in the two צירה vowels. This
raises the possibility that it is not ink, e.g. a speck on the vellum.</p>
<p>Note that almost by necessity, if we transcribe the <span class="romanized">yod</span> as having
a דגש, then the פתח must be “pulled back” from being a furtive פתח to being a normal פתח that
belongs to the <span class="romanized">yod</span>. This is because, unlike most additions of דגש,
here adding a דגש transforms the letter from being silent (an אם קריאה) to being (implicitly)
doubled (geminated)! If we give the <span class="romanized">yod</span> a דגש but do not pull back
the פתח to the <span class="romanized">yod</span>, we are proposing a pointing that goes beyond
surprising to nonsensical. To do so would be unreasonably uncharitable.</p>
<p>Although the position of the פתח (between <span class="romanized">yod</span> and ח) may seem to
support the idea that the פתח belongs to the <span class="romanized">yod</span>, this is actually a
common position for a furtive פתח. See, for example, the image we provide of
<span class="unpointed-tanakh">אלוה</span> in <a href="../jobn-details/0409.html">4:9</a> and
<a href="../jobn-details/1106.html">11:6</a>. So, the position of the פתח is actually more
consistent with the פתח belonging to the ח. (Or, if you prefer to think of furtive פתח in a
different way, it belongs to the ר (being the second of two vowels belonging to the ר.)</p>
<p><abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> silently ignores the possible דגש. Since
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> does not note any uncertainty in its transcription here (or
anywhere), it is hard to distinguish whether <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> has ignored the
mark in question on purpose or by accident.</p>
