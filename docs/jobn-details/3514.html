<p>In μY, the mark we would charitably interpret as דחי is very far forward: it is even a bit left
of center. As is often the case, this displacement from the expected location can perhaps be blamed
on a ל ascender encroaching from the line below. In μL and μA, the same ל encroachment occurs, but
by mere chance leaves space for דחי in the expected prepositive location.</p>
<p>It is challenging for us moderns to distinguish, in transcription, between the דחי, the טרחא, the
געיה, and the מרכא. One wonders whether this would have seemed challenging to the Tiberian Masoretes
or even the later carriers of their tradition such as the <span class="romanized">naqdan</span> of
μY. Although the Masoretes are characterized by (indeed famous for) a punctilious concern for
explicitness, it may be that they had something of a blind spot when it came to distinctions that
seemed obvious to them from context but are no longer obvious to us, particularly as understanding
of the poetic cantillation system has retracted down to a very few experts, none of whom seem to
have been consulted in the production of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job.</p>
