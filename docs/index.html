<li>A <a href="./jobn/job2_main_article.html">document</a>, “<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Job
was made in a bubble.”</li>
<li>A series of details pages used by that document, starting with
<a href="./jobn-details/0119.html">Job 1:19</a>. While most readers will only be interested in those
details as presented inside the main document, some may want to peruse the details pages directly.
