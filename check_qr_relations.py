"""
Validate the cross-record relations declared in pyauthor_util/qr_relations.py.

This is a *cross-record* check, so it cannot live in check_qr_consistency.py
(which is per-file AST and can't see sibling records). It resolves every
relation against RAW_QUIRKRECS and asserts that:

  * both endpoints exist and share the same qr-cv;
  * the kind is supported and the accent is known;
  * accent is conserved for kind "move" (present on the `from` record's μL
    side and absent from its consensus; present on the `to` record's consensus
    and absent from its μL side).

Exit codes:
  0 - All relations valid
  1 - One or more relations invalid

Usage:
  python check_qr_relations.py
